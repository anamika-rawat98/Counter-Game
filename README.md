1. Installed react app using vite as it is a better build tool and comes with fast refresh, HMR(allows
   modules (files) to be replaced in the browser without a full page reload) and build commands for deployements.

   npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react

2. Installed redux-toolkit and react-redux.
3. Used configure store and create slice functionalities from redux toolkit which made redux
   implementation easier and efficient.
4. Installed tailwind using vite -

   npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

   Added tailwind as a plugin in vite.config.js
   Imported tailwind in the root css file

5. Tailwind helps to write css faster with it's prebuild wrappers for stylings.
